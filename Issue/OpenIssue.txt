py2neo.database.ClientError: SyntaxError: Invalid input '{': expected whitespace, comment or a label name (line 1, column 17 (offset: 16))
"MERGE (nodeLbl: {name: "CEO"})"

Narendra Modi"
...

"MERGE (nodeLbl: {name: "Chairman"})"
"MERGE (nodeLbl:ORG {name: "The New York Times Company""})"
"MERGE (nodeLbl:ORG {name: "The New York Times""})"

I have handle special char thru code

##2 (NodeLabels.tsv) LinkedIn as ORG and also as PERSON, similar for lynada.com has labeled as ORG and also as PERSON, same for others

## Issue in Connectivity.tsv
LinkedIn, Allen Blue both are in both FromNode and ToNode, similar I saw with people associated with LinkedIn. Same are present for other nodes like Instagram, Lynda.com etc.
This causing wrong (both directional) relational directions.
eg:-
278	LinkedIn	Reid Hoffman	Founded
279	LinkedIn	Konstantin Guericke	Founded
280	LinkedIn	SlideShare	Produces
..
297	LinkedIn	Allen Blue	Founded

#####  Findings in Sathish's file
# Added header in the tsv files. Rename files same as Mike's file. Just rename with *_U.tsv to mark as unstructured.
# EdgeLabel is added to the connectivity files

# empty lines after every record. Code has taken care that.
# Duplicate entries like LinkedIn and Bright.com (EdgeID 889, 1409)
# Nodes names are have leading space so could note created compete , invested etc relationship. Taken care thru code.
# Some space issues with label names...Taken care in code.
# Relation present as acquire and acquiring (lematization)

CLEANING UP
1. we have total 40631 nodes with orphans
===>Deleting orphan now we have 682
##DELETE ORPHAN NODE
MATCH (n) WHERE NOT (n)--() DELETE n
