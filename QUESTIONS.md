# Interesting questions to ask

These questions are aggregated from our various discussions:

* Find the Venture firms that has funded LinkedIn and its competitors but not the acquisitions.
  (which will find those firms which are trying to gain from the whole market)
* Find the common and differentiating Business Units/segments for LinkedIn and its peers (competitors & Acquisitions)
* What is the longest path that satisfies some constraint?
* How many of each kind of node/edge are there?
* For a given edge type, what kind of nodes does it connect?
* Find how the law firm A is related to LinkedIn and report the connectivity in the path if it exists?
  (This would result like law firm A is part of the antagonist in the case "X" filed against the company "Z" which got acquired by LinkedIn)
* Who had the most pre-IPO funding amongst LinkedIn and its competitors?
* What was the worth of LinkedIn's acquisitions?
* How many notable lawsuits has LinkedIn encountered?
